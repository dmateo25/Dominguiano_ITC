            <h2>Grand Mosque</h2>
            <p>Most trips to Oman begin in the capital Muscat and high on everyone’s list is a visit to the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque.
                It’s a stunning modern mosque that lives up to its name with space for 20,000 worshippers.
                The extravagant main prayer hall features a massive chandelier, intricately detailed blue mosaic tiles, and the second largest handmade Iranian rug in the world—it took 600 women four years to weave.</p>

            <h2>Wahiba Sands</h2>
            <p>For the true desert experience head to Wahiba Sands for rolling sand dunes, camel rides, and 4WD adventures.
                We spent a night in a rustic goat-hair Bedouin tent at the foot of a huge dune which we climbed for sunset and sunrise. We watched camels wandering past, drank tea by the fire, and gazed at the sky lit up with stars. It was wonderfully peaceful.</p>

            <h2>Nizwa Fort</h2>
            <p>The 17th-century Nizwa Fort is one of the most popular places to visit in Oman.
                It features a massive circular tower which you can climb for views of the mosque, souq, distant rocky mountains, and the date palms that surround this oasis city. Nizwa Fort has been refurbished and there are now historical items on display like jewellery, tools, and a timeline of the area’s history.
